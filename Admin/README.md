# FinAccrual — ERP Sync Admin Dashboard
A modern, high-performance React dashboard designed for accounting firms to manage clients, accrual schedules, journal entries, master data, and workflows.
---

## Features
- **Global Monolithic State**: The entire application runs on a centralized, highly-reactive state tree using React Context and Reducers, ensuring data is instantly synchronized across all views (e.g., adding a client instantly updates the Dashboard statistics).
- **Authentication Gateway**: Login screen with email validation and password rules that connects to the backend API, with graceful offline/demo fallback during development.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Real-time statistical tracking of Active Clients, Active Schedules, Journal Entries, and Data Uploads.
- **Entity Management**: Fully functional CRUD interfaces for Clients, Schedules, Accounts, and Journal Entries.
- **Advanced Filtering & Search**: Instant, client-side text filtering across all major data tables.
- **Premium UI/UX**: Built with modern CSS variables, soft shadows, micro-animations, and clean typography. Toast notifications provided by `sonner`.
